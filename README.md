# Tiago Robot in Kitchen Simulation 
### ```Odometry```, ```Differential Kinematics```, ```LiDAR-based Mapping```, ```Probabilistic C-Spaces```, ```RRT, A*```, ```Behaviour Trees```

This repository contains a **Webots project** featuring a **Tiago robot** in a simulated kitchen environment. The project includes a detailed **world file** for the kitchen setup and **controller scripts** for managing the robot's behavior.

## Overview

- **Simulation Environment**: A kitchen world with realistic elements, allowing the Tiago robot to navigate and interact with its surroundings.
- **Robot**: The Tiago robot is configured with sensors and actuators to perform tasks within the kitchen.
- **Controllers**: Custom scripts to control the robotâ€™s behaviour which is to navigate to certain waypoints while simultaneously mapping the environment, planning path to goal location, generate trajectory and move through the trajectory.
